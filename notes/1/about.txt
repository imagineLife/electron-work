Electron
a mix of chrome &&  node

CHROME
- html5
- gpu accelleration
- blink
- v8
 
NODE
- filesystem access...
- native modules


WHO USES IT
- vsCode
- slack
- GitHub client
- wordpress desktop
- whatsApp desktop
...https://www.electronjs.org/apps


HERE, BUILDING...
- a txt-to-md translator
	- open/save to file-system
	- use default text-editing tool

- clipMaster, clipboard manager
	- transpile sass, babel, etc.
	- make a menu-bar app out of it
	- include global shortcuts
	- native notifications

ALSO
- integration tests (selenium)
- package the app for distribution
- setup a server to receive crash reports
- 


The "PROCESS MODEL" of electron
- starts using "main" entry in package.json
	- uses ONE main process
	- uses 0 or more "render" processes
		- these are like GUIS that are slaves of the main process
		... if there is no need for a "render" process, then... maybe just use a node server?!

	- npm start will run main.js, serving index.html, serving renderer.js && styles...etc


RUN THE THING.
npm run start
...should console.log('This is an Electron application!') from the main.js file in app/
NOTE it hangs till I close it.
